## planning

-   Tasks will be split into github issues, which will then be assigned to various members
-   Data types, may use type annotation in python

    ```
    Potentiometer readings: float
    servo angles: float
    pen state: bool (up or down)
    ```

Talal did some rough code, and I(Daniel) implemented them into our project structure.

## control flow

todo: do this
